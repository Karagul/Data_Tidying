The purpose of this project is to perform a Shiny app using data from the Word Bank, in order to create interactive and heat maps about economic and demographic data.

The data that we are going to use is made up with information about topics such as Ecomomic growth, Demographics and education, in particular:

 - Economy and Growth: GDPpc, Inflation, Trade Balance, Goverment debt, consumption and expenses.
 - Demography: Total population, active population, unemployment rate, life expectancy, birth rate and death rate.
 - Education: Education expenses, compulsory education, literacy rate, secondary transitions, trained teachers and repeaters.
 - Trade: Goods trade, tools duties, import terms, international tourism, logistic performance and taxes.
 - Science and tech: High-tech exports, R&D expenses, papers published, Researchers, patents request and intellectual property costs.

The app will contain the following information:

 - First section: Name of the country and some relevant information such as population, unemployment rate, and so on.
 - Second section: Descriptive information about the variables (potentially, scatter plots and distribution charts)
 - Third section: Time series of the selected variable and country, interactive chart.
 - Four section: World heat map, representing the selected variable, interactive on time.
