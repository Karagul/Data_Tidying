# Data Tidying Project

The purpose of this project is to perform a Shiny/Dash app using data from the Word Bank, in order to create interactive charts and heat maps about economic and demographic data.

The data we are going to use comes from the World Bank, and it is made up with information about topics such as Ecomomic growth, Demographics and education, in particular:

 - Economy and Growth: GDPpc, Inflation, Trade Balance, Goberment debt, consumption and expenses.
 - Demography: Total population, active population, unemployment rate, life expectancy, birth rate and death rate.
 - Education: Education expenses, compulsory education, literacy rate, secondary transitions, trained teachers and repeaters.
 - Trade: Goods trade, tools duties, import terms, international tourism, logistic performance and taxes.
 - Science and tech: High-tech exports, R&D expenses, papers published, Researchers, patents request and intellectual property costs.

We are going to use both, Shiny and Dash technologies to develop the project, so R and python are goint to be the programming languages used to do it.

The app will contain the following information, divided in four sections

 - First section: Name of the country and some relevant information such as population, uneployment rate, and so on.
 - Second section (divided in six): Main variables about a topic (among a list of topics).
 - Third section: Time series of the selected variable, interactive chart.
 - Four section: World heat map, representing the selected variable, and interacting with the third section (time series).
